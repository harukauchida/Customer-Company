        Instructions
    </h3>
    <br>
      <p>Please read the instructions carefully. You will be asked comprehension questions afterwards:</p>
    <br>
    <p>
        You have been matched randomly and anonymously with other study participants. There are two roles in this study: Customer and Company. </p>
    <p>
        <font size="+1"><b>You have been assigned the role of Customer!</b></font>
    </p>
    <br>

    <p>
Your task as the Customer for this study is to select 5 workers out of 10 whose math scores you will base your bonus payment off of. <b>The higher the 5 workers that you selected scored on the math quiz, the higher your bonus will be. </b>You will not be told of the math scores of each worker when choosing your workers.
        <br>
    <p>
There are 10 potential workers, each identified by 3 personal characteristics that they have disclosed: age, gender, and hobby. Each worker will be identified using these characteristics.
For example, a 20-year old male worker who reported running as a hobby will be referred to as <20, M, running> for the entirety of this study.
    </p>
     <p>
All 10 workers were recruited before this study was launched to ensure that the personal details are real. Your choice of workers directly affects which workers are paid. The workers that you choose to hire will be re-contacted and paid a wage after the completion of this study session. The workers that you do not choose will not receive any wage.    </p>
